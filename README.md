## About.  

In this repository, I will demonstrate the skills I have learned throughout the CS-330 Course. 

Some Skills Include.  
* Using API. 
* An understanding of abstract classes. 
* code structure. 
* Implement primitive shapes to construct desired meshes.
* Textures
* Shaders

## Course reflection.:mag_right:  

* New design skills such as light manipulations and texture wrapping along with constructing object meshes with primitive shapes have helped me create items in my project and emulate them to real-world objects as closely as I can.   
<p> 

* The design process I took when approaching this project was taking in items and breaking them down by what shapes are they constructed from, I then went ahead and started working on them one item at a time.
<p>

* These tactics will help me in future projects by helping me work in blocks to construct items or functions one at a time.
<p>
  
* This was the first time I had to work with API and shader files, one new strategy that I learned about at the very end of the project was using abstract classes to create multiple objects but with less code. 
<p>

* Iteration factored into my project by having a while loop that housed all the data that would need to be processed between every frame or iteration this also included user input. 
<p> 

* Through each milestone I have learned more about key concepts and methods that brought the project together, these include concepts such as textures, and vector math to implement vectors to illustrate light via Phong model. Each milestone brought my project to where it is today.
<p> 

* Computational graphics will play a vital role in future educational pathways as they display information that is easy to understand and represents data much more effectively, compared to raw data ultimately leading to a better understanding of what is being represented.
<p>

* This understanding will help me in my future profession by implementing graphics that can help the audience by supporting and visualizing data to a set team or audience.
